# CSRD-Rollback

A repo to keep the development of the project of CSRD.

It will contain three folders of code. `/GamePrototype/` for a small prototype of how the game should work. `/NetworkLib/` for the networking functions that we will use in the final project and `/RollbackGame/` for the full implementation of the game with rollback in it. That includes the rollback implementation.

## Schedule 

### First two weeks
For the first two weeks, we plan on working on populating the repository with code and ideas for the final development.

### Third week
For the third week, we need to give in a deliverable with 8+ pages. Work will be focused on writing it and sending it in given what we learnt in the first two weeks and what we plan on doing in the rest of the project.

### Fourth to Sixth week
For theses weeks, we plan on finalizing the `/RollbackGame/` folder first implementation.

### Seventh week
This week we find people to test the game, get metrics, change the code if something is off and iterate. Iterate again and again until it seems satisfactory.

### Ending
Finally, we write the last deliverable with what we learnt throughout the full project, the metrics we acquired and more!
