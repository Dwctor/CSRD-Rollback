# GamePrototype

This folder has the prototype of how the game will work. This includes the code in the main.c file and how to compile it with the Makefile.
All of the information of this folder will be kept and documented in the main.c file. You are expected to read it.

This game uses strictly [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). With that library the game can draw to the screen and keep a steady frame-rate.
Although this is only going to be tested on Linux systems, it should have no problems running in other operating systems.
